# AstroBot AI - Intelligent Satellite Maintenance System

## Introduction
AstroBot AI is an intelligent satellite maintenance system that allows users to monitor critical indicators such as battery level, temperature, fuel, pressure, oxygen level, and solar output in real-time. The system is developed using `Dash` for the user interface, and integrates with OpenAI's `GPT` model to provide intelligent responses via the chatbot.

## Features
- **Live Monitoring Dashboard:** Displays real-time metrics of the satellite's vital systems.
- **Chatbot Integration:** AstroBot can answer questions related to satellite maintenance and provide real-time status updates.
- **Dynamic Gauges and Indicators:** Visual representation of battery, temperature, fuel, and more.
- **Interactive Graphs:** View real-time changes in temperature and other parameters.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `dash`
- `dash_daq`
- `plotly`
- `openai`
- `python-dotenv`

You can install these dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
